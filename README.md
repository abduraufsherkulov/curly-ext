curly ext
==================

#### What This Extension Does

This Chrome extension deletes all cookies (including HTTP only cookies) by either send a postMessage from any javascript on any page or by clicking the extension action (i.e. clicking the icon).

This chrome extension is particularly useful when you need to delete cookies as part of an automated test.

### Delete All Cookies

To delete all cookies using javascript run the following line:

    window.postMessage({ type: "CLEAR_COOKIES_EXTENSION_API" }, "*");

### Delete Cookies Visible To JavaScript

To delete cookies for the domain and super-domains of current page using javascript run the following line:

    window.postMessage({ type: "CLEAR_COOKIES_DOCUMENT" }, "*");

Note: the CLEAR_COOKIES_DOCUMENT mode does not delete any cookie that has a path value as this is not possible using the document object.

### Receive Notification

It is also possible to be notified of when cookies have been cleared.  This is particularly important if a particular operation should not happen until you have guaranteed that cookies have been cleared.

To receive a notification of when the cookies have been cleared add an event listener as follows:

    window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        if (event.data.type && (event.data.type === "COOKIES_CLEARED_VIA_EXTENSION_API")) {
            // do something
        }
    });
